    <string name="interventure_desc">Is a Swiss IT nearshoring company. We are a team of great co-thinkers challenging the status quo. Every day.
        Do you as well? In everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo. We believe in thinking differently.
        The way we challenge the status quo is by striving every day to be better than the day before.
        We like to compete with ourselves, not others. We do not rest until we believe in what we do makes perfect sense.
        We like to be convinced with clever and clean software code. It should be as lean as possible and only as large as required.
        We like it to be performant and robust. In case it is able to learn and live by itself we have nothing against :) </string>
